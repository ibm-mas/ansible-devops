          *                                                                   *
          *  These playbooks are samples to demonstrate how to use the roles  *
          *  in this collection.                                              *
          *                                                                   *
          *  They are NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE as-is, they are a       *
          *  starting point for power users to aid in the development of      *
          *  their own Ansible playbooks using the roles in this collection   *
          *                                                                   *
          *  The recommended way to update MAS is to use the MAS CLI, which   *
          *  uses this Ansible Collection to deliver a complete managed       *
          *  lifecycle for your MAS instance.                                 *
          *                                                                   *
          *  This sample playbook only updates the version of the Maximo      *
          *  Operator Catalog installed on a cluster, which is a tiny         *
          *  fraction of the actions required to keep MAS and all it's        *
          *  dependencies up to date.                                         *
          *                                                                   *
