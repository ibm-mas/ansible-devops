# This task is important during CPD 4.6 > 4.8 upgrade as 4.8 version requires CPFS v4 in isolated mode (running in ibm-cpd-operators namespace)

# This task will disable CPFS v3 if detected:

# - Scale down ibm-common-service-operator, operand-deployment-lifecycle-manager and ibm-zen-operator deployments from ibm-common-services namespace (will be recreated when CPFS/ODLM v4 is installed)
# - Delete common-service operandconfig and operandregistry (will be recreated when ODLM v4 is installed)
# - Delete all namespace scope instances from ibm-common-services namespace (will be recreated when NamespaceScope v4 is installed)

# For further reference: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/foundational-services/4.4?topic=4x-isolated-migration#migrate-using-manual-steps
