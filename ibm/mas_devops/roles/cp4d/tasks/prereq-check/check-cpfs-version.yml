# Look up the default channel for the ibm-common-service-operator package manifest
# The way ODLM works (which we have to use) means that when an istance of MAS Core
# is installed in the cluster, the ODLM framework will automatically upgdate the installed
# version of the IBM common service operator to whatever is set as the default channel.
#
# This can cause the subsequent installation of the Licensing Operator to fail in
# horrible ways, setting the subscription channel correctly here will hopefully avoid
# this problem.
