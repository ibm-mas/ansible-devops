# This task checks if Cloud Pak Foundational Services is installed
# and for cases where CPD 4.6 is installed, it also prevents from continuing if CPFS is not found.
# In addition, if CPFS instance is found, it sets the installed version in a property 'cpfs_installed_version'

# 2. Check whether IBM Common Services are already installed
