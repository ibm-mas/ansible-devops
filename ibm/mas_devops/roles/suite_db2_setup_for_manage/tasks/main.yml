# TODO: We should do this locally, connecting to the Db2 instance using the route
# that we have created.  Execing into a container is considered bad practice in
# production environment, and we want this collection to be production friendly.
#
# However given that we want to get all of this moved into the manage operator
# ASAP, there is little point investing the effort to fix this in this collection,
# rather that effort should be put into migrating this code into the manage
# operator itself, so that this isn't even necessary!
