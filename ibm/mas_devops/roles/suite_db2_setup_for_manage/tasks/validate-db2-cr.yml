      This is an internal error. Please report this issue with the following details:
      - db2_instance_name: {{ db2_instance_name }}
      - db2_namespace: {{ db2_namespace }}

    fail_msg: |
      Db2 instance '{{ db2_instance_name }}' does not have status information.
      This may indicate the instance is still being created or there is an issue with the operator.

      Current CR state: {{ db2_cr_resource.status | default('No status') }}

      Please wait for the instance to initialize or check the operator logs:
      oc logs -n {{ db2_namespace }} -l name=db2u-operator --tail=50
    success_msg: "CR has valid status information"

  assert:
    that:
      - db2_cr_is_ready | bool
    fail_msg: |
      Db2 instance '{{ db2_instance_name }}' is not in Ready state.
      Current state: {{ db2_cr_resource.status.state | default('Unknown') }}

      Please wait for the instance to be ready before applying configuration.
      You can check the status with:
      oc get {{ db2_cr_type | lower }} {{ db2_instance_name | lower }} -n {{ db2_namespace }} -o yaml

      Common states and their meanings:
      - Pending: Instance is being created
      - Initializing: Instance is starting up
      - Ready: Instance is ready for configuration (required state)
      - Failed: Instance creation failed, check operator logs
    success_msg: "Db2 instance is Ready"

- name: "Validate required configuration version"
  assert:
    that:
      - db2_config_version is defined
      - db2_config_version != ""
    fail_msg: |
      Invalid or missing db2_config_version: {{ db2_config_version | default('undefined') }}

      Please set db2_config_version to a valid version.
      Example: db2_config_version: "1.0.0"
    success_msg: "Configuration version {{ db2_config_version }} is valid"
