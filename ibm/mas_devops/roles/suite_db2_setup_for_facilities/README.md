suite_db2_setup_for_facilities
==========================

This role shouldn't need to exist, it should be part of the Facilities operator, but is not so we have to do it as a separate step in the install flow for now.  The role will perform some initial setup on the Db2 instance that is needed to prepare it for use with the Real estate and Facilities application.

The role will copy scripts into the Db2 pod and execute it inside the container, this script will perform a number of configuration changes to the database as well as configuring the tablespaces for Maximo Real estate and facilities because the operator is not yet able to do this itself.
