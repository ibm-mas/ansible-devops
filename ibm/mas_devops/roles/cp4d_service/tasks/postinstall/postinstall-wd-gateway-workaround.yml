# Below is a nasty hack that we need to do until Watson Gateway issue is resolved https://github.ibm.com/watson-foundation-services/watson-platform-hybrid-cloud/issues/359
# The issue is that in CPD 4.7+, Watson Gateway lookups for IbmCpd custom resource name hardcoded to `ibmcpd-cr` and we've always use `ibmcpd` instead
# So in order to successfully provision WD instances, we need to create a temporary IbmCpd resource called `ibmcpd-cr` if it's not yet created and then delete it after Watson Discovery is fully installed
# We hope to get rid of this workaround by CPD 4.8.5 patch release, which is when it is supposed to have a fix that allows customizing the IbmCpd CR name

# Check hack is in place - check #1 : ibmcpd cr name is 'ibmcpd-cr'
- name: "Lookup for 'ibmcpd-cr' custom resource"
  kubernetes.core.k8s_info:
    api_version: cpd.ibm.com/v1
    kind: Ibmcpd
    namespace: "{{ cpd_instance_namespace }}"
    label_selectors:
      - "cp4d=wg_hack" # label it so we know it's the right one to delete it afterwards
  register: wg_ibmcpd_lookup

    var: wg_ibmcpd_lookup
