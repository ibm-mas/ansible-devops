# So, given the cirscuntances, we will prevent the minor version upgrade and point users to IBM support for assistance.

# Below is a nasty hack that we need to do until Watson Gateway issue is resolved https://github.ibm.com/watson-foundation-services/watson-platform-hybrid-cloud/issues/359
# The issue is that in CPD 4.7+, Watson Gateway lookups for IbmCpd custom resource name hardcoded to `ibmcpd-cr` and we've always use `ibmcpd` instead
# So in order to successfully provision WD instances, we need to create a temporary IbmCpd resource called `ibmcpd-cr` if it's not yet created and then delete it after Watson Discovery is fully installed
# We hope to get rid of this workaround by CPD 4.8.5 patch release, which is when it is supposed to have a fix that allows customizing the IbmCpd CR name
