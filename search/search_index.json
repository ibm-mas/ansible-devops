Warning The credentials to sign-in are the defaults for CP4D, which are admin/password . Yes, really! Required environment variables \uf0c1 The following required environment variables are common across all of the playbooks: CPD_ENTITLEMENT_KEY An IBM entitlement key that includes access to Cloud Pak for Data 3.5.0 CPD_STORAGE_CLASS Provide the storage class to use for Db2 MAS_INSTANCE_ID Provide the MAS instance ID that will be used in any generated MAS configuration files Lite install (install-lite.yml) \uf0c1 This playbook will only install CP4D, none of the Cloud Pak's supported services will be enabled allowing you to set these up seperately.

Required Variables \uf0c1 CPD_ENTITLEMENT_KEY An IBM entitlement key that includes access to Cloud Pak for Data 3.5.0 CPD_STORAGE_CLASS Provide the storage class to use for Db2. Example: ibmc-file-gold-gid Optional Variables \uf0c1 In addition to the above, this is the optional variable you can set before running the playbook: CPD_NAMESPACE Provide the namespace where Cloud Pak for Data is installed. Default is cpd-meta-ops Usage \uf0c1 Here is how you can use this playbook: export CPD_ENTITLEMENT_KEY=xxx export CPD_STORAGE_CLASS=ibmc-file-gold-gid ansible-playbook playbooks/cp4d/install-cp4d.yml DB2 Warehouse Instance (install-db2-api) \uf0c1 This playbook expects a CP4D with DB2 Warehouse service enabled already exists. Use it after install-cp4d . It can be used to create DB2 Warehouse instances against the same Cloud Pak for Data. It is useful if user wants to create a database for IoT and another for Manage. In additional, different from other DB2 Warehouse playbooks, this one uses REST APIs and not Operators to create the DB2 instance (operators are not working properly in CP4D 3.5). By using REST APIs internally, we have a bit more configuration possibilties here as well as the instance will be displayed in CP4D dashboard. Required Variables \uf0c1 CPD_DB2WH_INSTANCE_NAME Name of your database instance, visible in CP4D dashboard. Example: db2w-iot CPD_ENTITLEMENT_KEY An IBM entitlement key that includes access to Cloud Pak for Data 3.5.0 CPD_NAMESPACE Provide the namespace where Cloud Pak for Data is installed. CP4D playbooks create it, by default, in cpd-meta-ops MAS_INSTANCE_ID Provide the MAS instance ID that will be used in any generated MAS configuration files MAS_CONFIG Provide the path of the folder where the JDBCCfg yaml containing the credentials of this database will be saved at the end of the process. MAS_WORKSPACE_ID Id of the workspace that will bind the DB2W. Required only if MAS_CONFIG_SCOPE is wsapp MAS_APP_ID Id of the application that will bind the DB2W.

This file can be directly applied using oc apply -f /config/jdbc-db2w-iot-cpd-meta-ops.yml or added to the mas_config list variable used by the ibm.mas_devops.suite_install role to deploy and configure MAS. CP4D + DB2 Warehouse Service + DB2 Warehouse Instance (install-db2) \uf0c1 This playbook will install CP4D, with Db2 Warehouse enabled. Additionally, a Db2 Warehouse cluster will be created and a public TLS encrypted route is configured to allow external access to the cluster. The certificates are available from the internal-tls secret in the cpd-meta-ops namespace. The default user is db2inst1 and the password is available in the instancepassword secret in the same namespace.
