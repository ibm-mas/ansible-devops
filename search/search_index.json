Usage \u00a4 Run a Playbook \u00a4 The collection includes a number of playbooks that string together multiple roles, you can directly invoke them after installing the collection: ansible-playbook ibm.mas_devops.lite_core_roks Run a Role \u00a4 If you only want to perform a single action, you can directly invoke one of our roles from the command line without the need to build a playbook: ansible localhost -m include_role -a name=ibm.mas_devops.ocp_verify You can also use the run_role playbook: ROLE_NAME=cert_manager ansible-playbook ibm.mas_devops.run_role Running in Docker \u00a4 The easiest way to use this collection is to take advantage of the ibmmas/cli container image, this negates the need to install anything on your local machine (other than docker - or podman if you prefer). docker run -ti --rm --pull always quay.io/ibmmas/cli Local Install \u00a4 Install the collection direct from Ansible Galaxy , you must also install the mas-devops Python package. Python 3.11 is recommended as it is the most widely used version of Python within our development team, but any in-support version of Python should work. ansible-galaxy collection install ibm.mas_devops python3 -m pip install mas-devops Optionally, you can also pin the version of the collection that you install, allowing you to control exactly what version of the collection is in use in your automation: ansible-galaxy collection install ibm.mas_devops:18.10.4 python3 -m pip install mas-devops The ansible collection makes use of many dependencies, you can find install scripts showing how we install these dependencies in our own container image in the ibm-mas/cli-base repository, the dependencies you need will be determined by the roles that you intend to use, refer to the roles documentation for dependency infomation. Tip Many systems contain more than one installation of Python, when you install the mas-devops package you must install it to the Python that Ansible is configured to use. You can check the version being used by Ansible by reviewing the output of ansible --version . If you see the error message ERROR!

Execution Environment Image \u00a4 The execution environment image for ansible-devops builds on the latest ansible-automation-platform-24/ee-supported-rhel9 image from Red Hat that provides the ansible-core and Red Hat supported collections. The ansible-devops-ee image includes the ibm.mas_devops collection and all required client libraries to function. The image is uploaded to quay.io at quay.io/ibmmas/ansible-devops-ee How to setup Anisble Automation Platform \u00a4 Organization \u00a4 An Organization is a logical collection of Users, Teams, Projects, and Inventories, and is the highest level in the automation controller object hierarchy. Create an organization if you don't already have one: Inventory \u00a4 An Inventory is a collection of hosts against which jobs may be launched, the same as an Ansible inventory file. The ibm.mas_devops collection runs against localhost so an Inventory of hosts just requires the one host of localhost to be added but this might be important for any other roles you might want to execute outside of this collection but within this organization. Create an initial inventory if one doesn't exist yet: Ensure that the host entry has the following variables set to ensure a local connection: Execution Environment \u00a4 In Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) you can setup a new Execution Environment by specifying the image and tag. You can use either a versioned tag or latest such as quay.io/ibmmas/ansible-devops-ee:latest or quay.io/ibmmas/ansible-devops-ee:24.0.0 Credentials \u00a4 To use your own playbooks that are in source control management (SCM) you will need to setup credentials in AAP to fetch these (unless the repo is public). An example of this is providing a GitHub fine-grained access token which will just allow the token to read the contents of the repo. \u00a1 creds-2 Depending on if you have an exiting cluster or not, then you will need to setup the OpenShift or Kubernetes API Bearer Token credentials to access the Openshift cluster, which will be required on any Jobs that interect with the cluster. Project \u00a4 Once you have the execution environment setup you can now create a Project that will point to the source of your playbooks. It is recommended that you use your own source of playbooks rather than the playbooks contained in this repo, to give you full control over what is run to suit your needs. Create the Project and set the Execution Environment to be the one created eariler, and set the source control details and credentials needed for AAP to read your playbooks. Job Templates \u00a4 The Job Templates are what each Job is launched from and contains the details of what Playbook to execute. The Job is the executed instance of a Template that contains any specific values required. To create the Template add the Inventory, Project and Execution Environment setup previously. The playbook dropdown should contain all the playbooks that are found in your SCM (if no playbooks are shown then check the Troubleshooting section). At this point you can choose any other settings that you might want to use, and it is recommended to check the AAP documentation on this. Once the Job template is created then you can click on the created template and navigate to Survey . This is where you can provide any secure variables for your playbook that you don't want to keep in source control. You can choose the questions to ask and what type the variable should be. The variable name should make the variable name that the corresponding role is expecting. Finally, ensure that the Survey is Enabled: Workflow Templates \u00a4 The Workflow Templates allow you to configure a number of job templates (or other workflow templates) together. This can be useful when you want to use other roles from other collections (see the AAP Certified Content here ) as well as the ansible-devops collection. For example, you might want to run some AWS or VMWare roles to configure resources after or before the ansible-devops collection roles. How to run a Job \u00a4 Now you have the Job Template setup, you can launch the Job from that Template. Navigate to the Templates view and click the launch icon: Enter any survey questions you have configured: The Job now launches and you can see the output. The list of executing and executed jobs can be seen from the Jobs seciton Examples of playbooks \u00a4 You can use the ansbile-devops playbooks as a reference on how to setup your own playbooks. Defining your own playbooks gives you full control over what roles can be run and also include your own roles or roles from the supported Red Hat collection. If you are using the playbooks as a starting point then please note the following changes that would be required: Remove any pre_tasks related to environment variables Remove any lookups of environment variables from the playbook oneclick_core.yml \u00a4 An example of this is taking the oneclick_core.yml playbook: --- - hosts: localhost any_errors_fatal: true vars: # Install SLS # Note: We need to create some intermediate variables to construct sls_mongodb_cfg_file, # This is the only reason they feature here, all the roles that use these variables would also # load them directly from the same environment variables if they were not defined here. mas_config_dir: \"{{ lookup('env', 'MAS_CONFIG_DIR') }}\" mongodb_namespace: \"{{ lookup('env', 'MONGODB_NAMESPACE') | default('mongoce', True) }}\" sls_mongodb_cfg_file: \"{{ mas_config_dir }}/mongo-{{ mongodb_namespace }}.yml\" # Core Services Configuration mas_channel: \"{{ lookup('env', 'MAS_CHANNEL') | default('9.0.x', true) }}\" # Workspace Configuration mas_workspace_name: \"{{ lookup('env', 'MAS_WORKSPACE_NAME') | default('MAS Development', true) }}\" mas_workspace_id: \"{{ lookup('env', 'MAS_WORKSPACE_ID') | default('masdev', true) }}\" pre_tasks: # For the full set of supported environment variables refer to the playbook documentation - name: Check for required environment variables assert: that: # IBM - lookup('env', 'IBM_ENTITLEMENT_KEY') != \"\" # MAS - lookup('env', 'MAS_INSTANCE_ID') != \"\" - lookup('env', 'MAS_CONFIG_DIR') != \"\" # SLS - (lookup('env', 'SLS_LICENSE_ID') != \"\" and lookup('env', 'SLS_LICENSE_FILE') != \"\") or (lookup('env', 'SLS_ENTITLEMENT_FILE') != \"\") # DRO - lookup('env', 'DRO_CONTACT_EMAIL') != \"\" - lookup('env', 'DRO_CONTACT_FIRSTNAME') != \"\" - lookup('env', 'DRO_CONTACT_LASTNAME') != \"\" fail_msg: \"One or more required environment variables are not defined\" roles: # 1.

The aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key are variables set by AAP as a result of the Survey questions: --- - name: \"ocp-provision\" hosts: localhost vars: cluster_name: testcluster cluster_type: rosa ocp_version: 4.14.35 rosa_compute_nodes: 3 environment: AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: us-east-1 AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: \"{{ aws_access_key_id }}\" AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: \"{{ aws_secret_access_key }}\" roles: # 1. Provision the ROSA cluster - ibm.mas_devops.ocp_provision # 2. Login and verify the cluster is ready - ibm.mas_devops.ocp_login - ibm.mas_devops.ocp_verify # 3. Set up storage classes - ibm.mas_devops.ocp_efs Troubleshooting \u00a4 Helpful Links \u00a4 Red Hat AAP documentation Installing AAP in OCP Other install methods of AAP AAP Certified Content Can't see all output in log file \u00a4 The output for the job doesn't output all the data in the standard view. To see the expanded data you must click on the entry to see the details and then select JSON: My playbook or updated playbook can't be found \u00a4 If you have updated your Playbook in your SCM but it is not reflected in AAP then you can sync the Project. Navigate to the Project view and click the sync icon so the Project gets the latest revision. Job failed can I re-launch it? \u00a4 If the job fails and you want to relaunch with the same variables (from both hosts and survey), then you can re-launch the job from the Job page or the Jobs list page How to provide supporting files? \u00a4 If you have a file that is not a playbook but you want to reference it, then you can include this in the same repo as your playbooks as AAP will be syncing the whole repo. You can then reference these files from your playbook or roles, using a pth relative to the playbook being run. An exmaple of this is the entitlement_file which can be contained in your repo: and then referenced in your playbook in the path \"license_file/entitlement.lic\" : --- - hosts: localhost any_errors_fatal: true vars: mas_config_dir: \"/tmp\" mongodb_namespace: \"mongoce\" sls_mongodb_cfg_file: \"{{ mas_config_dir }}/mongo-{{ mongodb_namespace }}.yml\" entitlement_file: \"license_file/entitlement.lic\" roles: - ibm.mas_devops.mongodb - ibm.mas_devops.sls How do I set environment variables? \u00a4 Running in AAP means you can't set environment variables on the ansible controller before a playbook is executed. If a role in the ibm.mas_devops collection has an environment variable to be set there is normally a corresponding ansible variable. For exmaple, in the documentation for (kafka_action)[https://ibm-mas.github.io/ansible-devops/roles/kafka/#kafka_action] in the kafka role it says to set the environment variable KAFKA_VERSION , this is just setting the ansible role varible called kafka_version which you can set in your playbook. With ansible predence in place, the play vars or role vars will override the default vars that use the environment variable. Example setting play vars: --- - hosts: localhost any_errors_fatal: true vars: kafka_version: 3.7.0 roles: - ibm.mas_devops.kafka Example setting role vars: --- - hosts: localhost any_errors_fatal: true roles: - role: ibm.mas_devops.kafka vars: kafka_version: 3.7.0","title":"Ansible Automation Platform"},{"location":"execution-environment/#execution-environment","text":"Details on the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Execution Environment for the ibm.mas_devops Ansible Collection.","title":"Execution Environment"},{"location":"execution-environment/#execution-environment-image","text":"The execution environment image for ansible-devops builds on the latest ansible-automation-platform-24/ee-supported-rhel9 image from Red Hat that provides the ansible-core and Red Hat supported collections.

The backup and restore Ansible roles can also be used individually, allowing you to build your own customized backup and restore playbook covering exactly what you need. For example, you can only backup/restore Manage attachments . Important The backup and restore playbooks in this collection are still work in progress, they are not suitable for production use at this time. You may track development progress using the Backup & Restore label in the Github repository. Production-ready backup and restore options are detailed in the Backup and restore topic in the product documentation. Configuration - Storage \u00a4 You can save the backup files to a folder on your local file system by setting the following environment variables: Envrionment variable Required (Default Value) Description MASBR_STORAGE_LOCAL_FOLDER Yes The local path to save the backup files MASBR_LOCAL_TEMP_FOLDER No ( /tmp/masbr ) Local folder for saving the temporary backup/restore data, the data in this folder will be deleted after the backup/restore job completed. Configuration - Backup \u00a4 Envrionment variable Required (Default Value) Description MASBR_ACTION Yes Whether to run the playbook to perform a backup or a restore MASBR_BACKUP_TYPE No ( full ) Set full or incr to indicate the playbook to create a full backup or incremental backup. MASBR_BACKUP_FROM_VERSION No Set the full backup version to use in the incremental backup, this will be in the format of a YYYMMDDHHMMSS timestamp (e.g. 20240621021316 ). The playbooks are switched to backup mode by setting MASBR_ACTION to backup . Full Backups \u00a4 If you set environment variable MASBR_BACKUP_TYPE=full or do not specify a value for this variable, the playbook will take a full backup. Incremental Backups \u00a4 You can set environment variable MASBR_BACKUP_TYPE=incr to indicate the playbook to take an incremental backup. Important Only supports creating incremental backup for MonogDB, Db2 and persistent volume data. The playbook will always create a full backup for other type of data regardless of whether this variable be set to incr . The environment variable MASBR_BACKUP_FROM_VERSION is only valid if MASBR_BACKUP_TYPE=incr . It indicates which backup version that the incremental backup to based on. If you do not set a value for this variable, the playbook will try to find the latest Completed Full backup from the specified storage location, and then take an incremental backup based on it. Important The backup files you specified by MASBR_BACKUP_FROM_VERSION must be a Full backup. And the component name and data types in the specified Full backup file must be same as the current incremental backup job. Configuration - Restore \u00a4 Envrionment variable Required (Default Value) Description MASBR_ACTION Yes Whether to run the playbook to perform a backup or a restore MASBR_RESTORE_FROM_VERSION Yes Set the backup version to use in the restore, this will be in the format of a YYYMMDDHHMMSS timestamp (e.g. 20240621021316 ) MASBR_RESTORE_OVERWRITE Yes Set whether the restore should overwrite any existing data or if we should stop and FAIL if there is data detected in the directory. WARNING: This will overwrite all data when restoring! The playbooks are switched to restore mode by setting MASBR_ACTION to restore . You must specify the MASBR_RESTORE_FROM_VERSION environment variable to indicate which version of the backup files to use. In the case of restoring from an incremental backup, the corresponding full backup will be restored first before continuing to restore the incremental backup. Backup/Restore for MongoDB \u00a4 This playbook ibm.mas_devops.br_mongodb will invoke the role mongodb to backup/restore the MongoDB databases. This playbook supports backing up and restoring databases for an in-cluster MongoDB CE instance. If you are using other MongoDB venders, such as IBM Cloud Databases for MongoDB, Amazon DocumentDB or MongoDB Altas Database, please refer to the corresponding vender's documentation for more information about their provided backup/restore service. Environment Variables \u00a4 MONGODB_NAMESPACE : By default the backup and restore processes will use a namespace of mongoce , if you have customized the install of MongoDb CE you must set this environment variable to the appropriate namespace you wish to backup from/restore to. MAS_INSTANCE_ID : Required . This playbook supports backup/restore MongoDB databases that belong to a specific MAS instance, call the playbook multiple times with different values for MAS_INSTANCE_ID if you wish to back up multiple MAS instances that use the same MongoDB CE instance. MAS_APP_ID : Optional . By default, this playbook will backup all databases belonging to the specified MAS instance. You can backup the databases only belong to a specific MAS application by setting this environment variable to a supported MAS application id core , manage , iot , monitor , health , optimizer or visualinspection .

The backup job folder is named by following this format: {BACKUP COMPONENT}-{INSTANCE ID}-{BACKUP TYPE}-{BACKUP VERSION} . When using playbook to backup multiple components at once, all backup job folders will be assigned to the same backup version. In above example, the same backup version 20240621122530 for backing up mongodb and core components. backup.yml : keep the backup job information database : data type for database. This folder save the backup files of MongoDB database, Db2 database. namespace : data type for namespace resources. This folder save the exported namespace resources. pv : data type for persistent volume. This folder save the persistent volume data, e.g. the Manage attachments, VI images and models. log : this folder save all job running log files In addition to the backup jobs, we also save restore jobs in the specified storage location.

This will make available new operator updates, which will be automatically applied across the cluster. These updates will not change the functionality of the software in your cluster, they will only carry fixes for security vulnerabilities and bugs. Note If you are using the dynamic catalog ( ibm-maximo-operator-catalog:v8 ) this playbook can be ignored, as you will recieve catalog updates in your cluster as soon as they are released. This playbook is specifically for customers who choose to use static catalogs to control the consumption of updates in their cluster. This is distinct from an upgrade , which will modify the operator subscriptions on your cluster to deliver new features. Performing an updating may make new upgrades available in the cluster, but it will never initiate the upgrade, you must choose when to upgrade. Playbook Content \u00a4 Install IBM Operator Catalog (1 minute) Preparation \u00a4 You will need to determine the version of the IBM Maximo Operator Catalog that you wish to update to. Generally speaking, you should update the most recent catalog available.

For more information about the specific CPD services channels and versions associated to a particular Cloud Pak for Data release can be found here . Services Supported \u00a4 These services can be deployed and configured using this role: Watson Studio required by Predict Watson Machine Learning required by Predict Analytics Services (Apache Spark) required by Predict Watson OpenScale an optional dependency for Predict SPSS Modeler optional dependency for Predict Watson Discovery required by Assist - Not supported with CPD 5.0 Cognos Analytics optional dependency for Manage application Info Install CP4D Services (~30 Minutes - 1 hour for each service) All timings are estimates. Upgrade \u00a4 This role also supports seamlessly CPD services minor version upgrades (CPD 4.6.x > CPD 4.8.0, CPD 4.8.0 > CPD 5.0.0 or CPD 5.0.0 > 5.1.0), as well as patch version upgrades (e.g. CPD 4.6.0 -> CPD 4.6.6), with the exception of Watson Discovery . All you need to do is to define cpd_product_version variable to the version you target to upgrade and run this role for a particular CPD service. It's important that before you upgrade CPD services, the CPD Control Plane/Zen is also upgraded to the same release version. For more information about IBM Cloud Pak for Data upgrade process, refer to the CPD official documentation . Application Support For more information on how Predict and HP Utilities make use of Watson Studio, refer to Predict/HP Utilities documentation Warning The reconcile of many CP4D resources will be marked as Failed multiple times during initial installation, these are misleading status updates , the install is just really slow and the operators can not properly handle this. For example, if you are watching the install of CCS you will see that each rabbitmq-ha pod takes 10-15 minutes to start up and it looks like there is a problem because the pod log will just stop at a certain point. If you see something like this as the last message in the pod log WAL: ra_log_wal init, open tbls: ra_log_open_mem_tables, closed tbls: ra_log_closed_mem_tables be assured that there's nothing wrong, it's just there's a long delay between that message and the next ( starting system coordination ) being logged. Note : Watson Discovery 4.8.x introduces breaking changes that blocks seamless upgrade from 4.6.x. It requires backing up your data, uninstall 4.6.x, install 4.8.x and restoring Watson Discovery data. Thus, this action requires additional steps that are not covered by this automation.

Application Support For more information on how Predict and HP Utilities make use of Watson Studio, refer to Predict/HP Utilities documentation Warning The reconcile of many CP4D resources will be marked as Failed multiple times during initial installation, these are misleading status updates , the install is just really slow and the operators can not properly handle this. For example, if you are watching the install of CCS you will see that each rabbitmq-ha pod takes 10-15 minutes to start up and it looks like there is a problem because the pod log will just stop at a certain point. If you see something like this as the last message in the pod log WAL: ra_log_wal init, open tbls: ra_log_open_mem_tables, closed tbls: ra_log_closed_mem_tables be assured that there's nothing wrong, it's just there's a long delay between that message and the next ( starting system coordination ) being logged. Note : Watson Discovery 4.8.x introduces breaking changes that blocks seamless upgrade from 4.6.x. It requires backing up your data, uninstall 4.6.x, install 4.8.x and restoring Watson Discovery data. Thus, this action requires additional steps that are not covered by this automation.

If you already have db2 operator and db2 instances running in separate namespaces, this role will take care of migrating (by deleting & reinstalling) the db2 operators from ibm-common-services to the namespace defined by db2_namespace property (in case of a new role execution for a db2 install or db2 upgrade). A private root CA certificate is created and is used to secure the TLS connections to the database. A Db2 Warehouse cluster will be created along with a public TLS encrypted route to allow external access to the cluster (access is via the ssl-server nodeport port on the -db2u-engn-svc service). Internal access is via the -db2u-engn-svc service and port 50001. Both the external route and the internal service use the same server certificate. The private root CA certificate and the server certificate are available from the db2u-ca and db2u-certificate secrets in the db2 namespace. The default user is db2inst1 and the password is available in the instancepassword secret in the same namespace. You can examine the deployed resources in the db2 namespace.

Optional Environment Variable: DB2_TEMP_STORAGE_ACCESSMODE Default: ReadWriteOnce Role Variables - Resource Requests \u00a4 These variables allow you to customize the resources available to the Db2 pod in your cluster. In most circumstances you will want to set these properties because it's impossible for us to provide a default value that will be appropriate for all users. We have set defaults that are suitable for deploying Db2 onto a dedicated worker node with 4cpu and 16gb memory. Tip Note that you must take into account the system overhead on any given node when setting these parameters, if you set the requests equal to the number of CPU or amount of memory on your node then the scheduler will not be able to schedule the Db2 pod because not 100% of the worker nodes' resource will be available to pod on that node, even if there's only a single pod on it. Db2 is sensitive to both CPU and memory issues, particularly memory, we recommend setting requests and limits to the same values, ensuring the scheduler always reserves the resources that Db2 expects to be available to it. db2_cpu_requests \u00a4 Define the Kubernetes CPU request for the Db2 pod.

Optional Environment Variable: DB2_INSTANCE_DBM_CONFIG Default: None db2_instance_registry \u00a4 Overwrites the db2ucluster instance database configuration settings under spec.environment.instance.registry section. You can define parameters to be included in this section using semicolon separated values.

Both Strimzi and Red Hat AMQ streams component are massively scalable, distributed, and high-performance data streaming platform based on the Apache Kafka project. Both offer a distributed backbone that allows microservices and other applications to share data with high throughput and low latency. As more applications move to Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift, it is increasingly important to be able to run the communication infrastructure on the same platform. Red Hat OpenShift, as a highly scalable platform, is a natural fit for messaging technologies such as Kafka. The AMQ streams component makes running and managing Apache Kafka OpenShift native through the use of powerful operators that simplify the deployment, configuration, management, and use of Apache Kafka on Red Hat OpenShift. The AMQ streams component is part of the Red Hat AMQ family, which also includes the AMQ broker, a longtime innovation leader in Java\u2122 Message Service (JMS) and polyglot messaging, as well as the AMQ interconnect router, a wide-area, peer-to-peer messaging solution. Under the covers, AMQ streams leverages Strimzi's architecture, resources and configurations. Note: The MAS license does not include entitlement for AMQ streams. The MAS Devops Collection supports this Kafka deployment as an example only. Therefore, we recommend the use of Strimzi for an opensource Kafka provider. Tip The role will generate a yaml file containing the definition of a Secret and KafkaCfg resource that can be used to configure the deployed cluster as the MAS system Kafka. This file can be directly applied using oc apply -f $MAS_CONFIG_DIR/kafkacfg-amqstreams-system.yaml or used in conjunction with the suite_config role.

Both Strimzi and Red Hat AMQ streams component are massively scalable, distributed, and high-performance data streaming platform based on the Apache Kafka project. Both offer a distributed backbone that allows microservices and other applications to share data with high throughput and low latency. As more applications move to Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift, it is increasingly important to be able to run the communication infrastructure on the same platform. Red Hat OpenShift, as a highly scalable platform, is a natural fit for messaging technologies such as Kafka. The AMQ streams component makes running and managing Apache Kafka OpenShift native through the use of powerful operators that simplify the deployment, configuration, management, and use of Apache Kafka on Red Hat OpenShift. The AMQ streams component is part of the Red Hat AMQ family, which also includes the AMQ broker, a longtime innovation leader in Java\u2122 Message Service (JMS) and polyglot messaging, as well as the AMQ interconnect router, a wide-area, peer-to-peer messaging solution. Under the covers, AMQ streams leverages Strimzi's architecture, resources and configurations. Note: The MAS license does not include entitlement for AMQ streams. The MAS Devops Collection supports this Kafka deployment as an example only. Therefore, we recommend the use of Strimzi for an opensource Kafka provider. Tip The role will generate a yaml file containing the definition of a Secret and KafkaCfg resource that can be used to configure the deployed cluster as the MAS system Kafka.

By default a three member MongoDB replica set will be created. The cluster will bind six PVCs, these provide persistence for the data and system logs across the three nodes. Currently there is no support built-in for customizing the cluster beyond this configuration. Tip The role will generate a yaml file containing the definition of a Secret and MongoCfg resource that can be used to configure the deployed instance as the MAS system MongoDb. This file can be directly applied using oc apply -f $MAS_CONFIG_DIR/mongocfg-mongoce-system.yaml or used in conjunction with the suite_config role. Prerequisites \u00a4 To run this role with providers as ibm or aws you must have already installed the AWS CLI . Also, you need to have AWS user credentials configured via aws configure command or simply export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables with your corresponding AWS username credentials prior running this role when provider is either ibm or aws . To run the docdb_secret_rotate MONGODB_ACTION when the provider is aws you must have already installed the Mongo Shell . This role will install a GrafanaDashboard used for monitoring the MongoDB instance when the provided is community and you have run the grafana role previously. If you did not run the grafana role then the GrafanaDashboard won't be installed. Role Variables - Common \u00a4 mas_instance_id \u00a4 The instance ID of Maximo Application Suite that the MongoCfg configuration will target. If this or mas_config_dir are not set then the role will not generate a MongoCfg template. Environment Variable: MAS_INSTANCE_ID Default Value: None mas_config_dir \u00a4 Local directory to save the generated MongoCfg resource definition. This can be used to manually configure a MAS instance to connect to the Mongo cluster, or used as an input to the suite_config role.

It is important to understand that the MongoDB Community operator persists data within Persistent Volume Claims. These claims should not be removed inadvertent deletion of the mongoce namespace could result in data loss. MongoDB Replica Set Pods Will Not Start \u00a4 MongoDB 5 has introduced new platform specific requirements. Please consult the Platform Support Notes for detailed information. It is of particular importance to confirm that the AVX instruction set is exposed or available to the MongoDB workloads. This can easily be determined by entering any running pod on the same OpenShift cluster where MongoDB replica set members are failing to start. Once inside of a running pod the following command can be executed to confirm if the AVX instruction set is available: cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep flags | grep avx If avx is not found in the available flags then either the physical processor hosting the OpenShift cluster does not provide the AVX instruction set or the virtual host configuration is not exposing the AVX instruction set. If the latter is suspected the virtual hosting documentation should be referenced for details on how to expose the AVX instruction set. LDAP Authentication \u00a4 If authenticating via LDAP with PLAIN specified for authMechanism then configDb must be set to $external in the MongoCfg. The field configDb in the MongoCfg refers to the authentication database. CA Certificate Renewal \u00a4 Warning If the MongoDB CA Certificate expires the MongoDB replica set will become unusable. Replica set members will not be able to communicate with each other and client applications (i.e. Maximo Application Suite components) will not be to connect. In order to renew the CA Certificate used by the MongoDB replica set the following steps must be taken: Delete the CA Certificate resource Delete the MongoDB server Certificate resource Delete the Secrets resources associated with both the CA Certificate and Server Certificate Delete the Secret resource which contains the MongoDB configuration parameters Delete the ConfigMap resources which contains the CA certificate Delete the Secret resource which contains the sever certificate and private key The following steps illustrate the process required to renew the CA Certificate, sever certificate and reconfigure the MongoDB replica set with the new CA and server certificates. The first step is to stop the Mongo replica set and MongoDb CE Operator pod. oc project mongoce oc delete deployment mongodb-kubernetes-operator Important Make sure the MongoDB Community operator pod has terminated before proceeding. oc delete statefulset mas-mongo-ce Important Make sure all pods in the mongoce namespace have terminated before proceeding Remove expired CA Certificate and Server Certificate resources. Clean up MongoDB Community configuration and then run the mongodb role. oc delete certificate mongo-ca-crt oc delete certificate mongo-server oc delete secret mongo-ca-secret oc delete secret mongo-server-cert oc delete secret mas-mongo-ce-config oc delete configmap mas-mongo-ce-cert-map oc delete secret mas-mongo-ce-server-certificate-key export ROLE_NAME=mongodb ansible-playbook ibm.mas_devops.run_role Once the mongodb role has completed the MongoDb CE Operator pod and Mongo replica set should be configured. After the CA and server Certificates have been renewed you must ensure that that MongoCfg Suite CR is updated with the new CA Certificate. First obtain the CA Certificate from the Secret resource mongo-ca-secret . Then edit the Suite MongoCfg CR in the Maximo Application Suite core namespace. This is done by updating the appropriate certificate under .spec.certificates in the MongoCfg CR: spec: certificates: - alias: ca crt: | -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- -----END CERTIFICATE----- If an IBM Suite Licensing Service (SLS) is also connecting to the MongoDB replica set the LicenseService CR must also be updated to reflect the new MongoDB CA. This can be added to the .spec.mongo.certificates section of the LicenseService CR. mongo: certificates: - alias: mongoca crt: | -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- -----END CERTIFICATE----- Once the CA certificate has been updated for the MongoCfg and LicenseService CRs several pods in the core and SLS namespaces might need to be restarted to pick up the changes. This would include but is not limited to coreidp, coreapi, api-licensing.

Once inside of a running pod the following command can be executed to confirm if the AVX instruction set is available: cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep flags | grep avx If avx is not found in the available flags then either the physical processor hosting the OpenShift cluster does not provide the AVX instruction set or the virtual host configuration is not exposing the AVX instruction set.

Replica set members will not be able to communicate with each other and client applications (i.e. Maximo Application Suite components) will not be to connect. In order to renew the CA Certificate used by the MongoDB replica set the following steps must be taken: Delete the CA Certificate resource Delete the MongoDB server Certificate resource Delete the Secrets resources associated with both the CA Certificate and Server Certificate Delete the Secret resource which contains the MongoDB configuration parameters Delete the ConfigMap resources which contains the CA certificate Delete the Secret resource which contains the sever certificate and private key The following steps illustrate the process required to renew the CA Certificate, sever certificate and reconfigure the MongoDB replica set with the new CA and server certificates. The first step is to stop the Mongo replica set and MongoDb CE Operator pod. oc project mongoce oc delete deployment mongodb-kubernetes-operator Important Make sure the MongoDB Community operator pod has terminated before proceeding. oc delete statefulset mas-mongo-ce Important Make sure all pods in the mongoce namespace have terminated before proceeding Remove expired CA Certificate and Server Certificate resources. Clean up MongoDB Community configuration and then run the mongodb role. oc delete certificate mongo-ca-crt oc delete certificate mongo-server oc delete secret mongo-ca-secret oc delete secret mongo-server-cert oc delete secret mas-mongo-ce-config oc delete configmap mas-mongo-ce-cert-map oc delete secret mas-mongo-ce-server-certificate-key export ROLE_NAME=mongodb ansible-playbook ibm.mas_devops.run_role Once the mongodb role has completed the MongoDb CE Operator pod and Mongo replica set should be configured. After the CA and server Certificates have been renewed you must ensure that that MongoCfg Suite CR is updated with the new CA Certificate. First obtain the CA Certificate from the Secret resource mongo-ca-secret . Then edit the Suite MongoCfg CR in the Maximo Application Suite core namespace. This is done by updating the appropriate certificate under .spec.certificates in the MongoCfg CR: spec: certificates: - alias: ca crt: | -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- -----END CERTIFICATE----- If an IBM Suite Licensing Service (SLS) is also connecting to the MongoDB replica set the LicenseService CR must also be updated to reflect the new MongoDB CA. This can be added to the .spec.mongo.certificates section of the LicenseService CR. mongo: certificates: - alias: mongoca crt: | -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- -----END CERTIFICATE----- Once the CA certificate has been updated for the MongoCfg and LicenseService CRs several pods in the core and SLS namespaces might need to be restarted to pick up the changes.

Usage \u00a4 If you set up the registry with a loadbalancer service you will be able to push to the registry via the cluster's hostname, but before you can use the registry you will need to install the registry's CA certificate and restart the Docker daemon so that your client trusts the new registry: CACERT=$(oc -n airgap-registry get secret airgap-registry-certificate -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}' | base64 -d) DOMAIN=$(oc get ingress.config cluster -o jsonpath='{.spec.domain}') sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/$DOMAIN\\:32500/ sudo echo \"$CACERT\" > /etc/docker/certs.d/$DOMAIN\\:32500/ca.crt sudo service docker restart You can now use the registry as normal: DOMAIN=$(oc get ingress.config cluster -o jsonpath='{.spec.domain}') docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal $DOMAIN:32500/ubi8/ubi-minimal docker push $DOMAIN:32500/ubi8/ubi-minimal If you set up the registry with a clusterip service you will only be able to push to the registry after using port forwarding: oc -n airgap-registry port-forward deployment/airgap-registry 9000:5000 docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal localhost:9000/ubi8/ubi-minimal docker push localhost:9000/ubi8/ubi-minimal However, you will still need to set up Docker trust for the \"local\" registry: CACERT=$(oc -n airgap-registry get secret airgap-registry-certificate -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\\.crt}' | base64 -d) sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/$DOMAIN\\:32500/ sudo mkdir /etc/docker/certs.d/localhost\\:9000 sudo echo \"$CACERT\" > /etc/docker/certs.d/localhost\\:9000/ca.crt sudo service docker restart Usage for tear-down action \u00a4 This role can also be used to permanently delete a mirror registry from a given cluster by setting the registry_action to tear-down and specifying the corresponding registry_namespace , if not using the default value. Note that the tear-down action deletes the registry completely including the PVC storage and the registry namespace. To start up the registry again, the role needs to be run again with the registry_action on default or setup . Images previously stored in the registry before the tear-down will no longer be available and will need to be mirrored again once the registry setup has completed. Take precaution when using this function and expect that images can no longer be accessed from the registry that has been torn down. Note: Recreating the registry will also create a new ca cert for the new registry. An appropriate time to use this tear-down function is when the registry has too many images that are not being used or when there has been a shift to support newer versions but images of older versions are clogging the registry. The tear-down function frees the disk space and allows for a new registry to be setup. Role Variables \u00a4 registry_action \u00a4 The action to perform with this role.

Note : this role will take no action when mas_manual_cert_mgmt is set to True DNS management \u00a4 There are two different ways this role controls DNS entries in the provider: Top Level DNS entries \u00a4 This mode will create the entries directly under your DNS zone. Use this when the DNS zone matches the MAS domain exactly. If your MAS installation will be using the domain mymas.mycompany.com and you have a DNS zone for mymas.mycompany.com then you will be creating top-level DNS entries for MAS, e.g. admin , home , & api . Subdomain DNS entries \u00a4 This mode will create DNS entries in the zone under a subdomain. Use this when your DNS zone will be used for more than just one MAS instance. If your MAS installation will be using the domain mymas.mycompany.com and you have a DNS zone for mycompany.com then you will be creating subdomain DNS entries for MAS, e.g. admin.mymas , home.mymas , & api.mymas . CIS and Cloudflare integrations support both mode of DNS management. A single optional variable is required to enable subdomain DNS management, in the examples above you would set these to mymas : cis_subdomain cloudflare_subdomain Let's Encrypt Integration \u00a4 Both the CIS and Cloudflare options also enable integration with Let's Encrypt for automatic certificate management via IBM Certificate Manager. Each will create a new ClusterIssuer which can be used when installing Maximo Application Suite: Cloudflare Let's Encrypt ClusterIssuer: {{ mas_instance_id }}-cloudflare-le-prod IBM Cloud Internet Services Let's Encrypt ClusterIssuer: {{ mas_instance_id }}-cis-le-prod If you want to use Let's Encrypt certificates in your MAS installation you will need to configure the mas_cluster_issuer variable in the suite_install role, setting it to the name of the ClusterIssuer as documented above. Note There are issues with how cert-manager works with LetsEncrypt staging servers. It creates a secret for the certificate that doesn't contain the LetsEncrypt CA, but the staging service does not use a well known cert so we end up with MAS unable to trust the certificates generated by LetsEncrypt staging. At present there is no workaround for this, so do not use the LetsEncrypt staging certificate issuer.

In other words cloudflare_subdomain.cloudflare_zone should equal mas_domain . Optional Environment Variable: CLOUDFLARE_SUBDOMAIN Default: None Role Variables - IBM Cloud Internet Services DNS Integration \u00a4 Note When using CIS integration, some resources will be installed in the cluster such as RBACs, API Services and CIS Webhook deployments. In OCP 4.12+, to avoid CIS webhook deployment failure at start up, this role will grant anyuid permission to cert-manager-webhook-ibm-cis service account so it can fully access the cert-manager-webhook-ibm-cis deployment pod as a workaround: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z cert-manager-webhook-ibm-cis -n ibm-common-services cis_email \u00a4 Required if dns_provider is set to cis .

Optional Environment Variable: SAAS_MODE Default: false Role Variables - AWS Route 53 \u00a4 Prerequisites \u00a4 To run this role successfully you must have already installed the AWS CLI . Also, you need to have AWS user credentials configured via aws configure command or simply export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables with your corresponding AWS username credentials prior running this role. Note In some cases, the Route 53 zone may not resolve the certificate challenges generated by IBM Certificate Manager, which could cause a problem while issuing the public certificates via Let's Encrypt. In this case, a manual workaround might be needed in cert-manager-controller pod to enable recursive nameservers. For more details on how to apply this workaround, refer to this documentation . This workaround is not automated, as most of the times this is not needed, but when it is, it requires the cert-manager-controller pod to be stopped, thus we want to avoid making this behavior as standard approach. route53_hosted_zone_name \u00a4 AWS Route53 Hosted Zone name. Required. Environment Variable: ROUTE53_HOSTED_ZONE_NAME Default Value: None route53_hosted_zone_region \u00a4 AWS Route53 Hosted Zone region. Required. Environment Variable: ROUTE53_HOSTED_ZONE_REGION Default Value: Same value as defined in AWS_REGION , or if none defined, then us-east-2 is the defaulted region. route53_subdomain \u00a4 If a subdomain is defined, this will be used to create the corresponding CNAME entries in the targeted Route53 hosted zone instance. Therefore, the Route53 subdomain + the Route53 hosted zone name defined, when combined, needs to match with the chosen MAS Domain, otherwise the DNS records won't be able to get resolved. Example: MAS Top Level Domain: my-mas-instance.mycompany.com AWS Route53 hosted zone name: mycompany.com AWS Route53 subdomain: my-mas-instance Optional.
